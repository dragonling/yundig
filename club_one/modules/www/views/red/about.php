								  <h2>About BigBusiness LLC</h2>
								  This is a perfect place to place some sort of impressive info on how great your company is (it is great after all, isn’t it?). Don’t hesitate to put here anything that you think may positively influence the audience - whatever that may be (including what pets live in your office). But what you usually see at most of the “About Us” pages is the history of the project, team members, some sort of mission and objectives statements - that’s the standard for the corporate website.

								  <h2>Our History</h2>
								  <img class="img-indent alt" alt="" src="images/image_122x122.gif" />
								  <p>Ok, we all have started with something, right? Whatever your story is, it is better that you share the most significant parts of this story with the audience. Plus you may want to put some timeline-style milestones. Like these ones:</p>
								  <p><strong class="txt1">1997</strong> - started out as garage-based financial expert consulting his classmates and his grandpa.</p>
								  <img class="img-indent fright" alt="" src="images/image_122x122.gif" />
								  <p><strong class="txt1">1998 - 2000</strong> - the company still works in garage but the secretary has now joined the team after two-year negotiations.</p>
								  <p><strong class="txt1">2000 - 2003</strong> - moved to a real office because John’s mom and dad bought a second car and there’s no more room in the garage.</p>
								  <p><strong class="txt1">2003 - 2008</strong> - the company became one of the top players of the financial market.</p>
								  <strong class="txt1">2008</strong> - present - well, recession... Back to the garage...
